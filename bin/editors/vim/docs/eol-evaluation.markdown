set listchars=eol:$

I use the eol -character because

1. you cannot have spaces in .git/info/exclude after the files
2. you will have problems when you do not know about extra spaces
...

One disadvantage of EOL is when you copy by mouse
 - I do not know how you can get rid of the eol temporarily,
   similarly as you can `set nonumber`
